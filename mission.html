  <h2>Our Mission</h2>

  <p>
    Renegade of Funk Creations is an independent, artist-led initiative dedicated to using digital art,
    symbolic storytelling, and creative expression as tools for emotional healing, reflection, and community
    support. Influenced by surrealist and visionary traditions, this project creates spaces where people can
    explore their inner world safely and at their own pace.
  </p>

  <p>
    This effort is currently in its early stages of becoming an official nonprofit organization. The long-term
    goal is to provide accessible art-based support for veterans, disabled individuals, people in recovery,
    and anyone seeking a creative outlet for emotional expression. This project is not a business venture and
    does not offer financial returns, investments, or profit-sharing of any kind. Participation and support
    are entirely voluntary and mission-driven.
  </p>

  <p>
    The purpose of this space is to create opportunities for people to help each other through creativity —
    whether through shared art sessions, collaborative projects, therapeutic workshops, or community-driven
    storytelling. Every contribution, whether time, attention, or resources, goes directly toward expanding
    these programs and making them accessible to those who need them most.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site is designed with trauma-informed principles in mind. Visitors will be able to choose the type
    of content they are comfortable viewing, ensuring that no one is exposed to unexpected or overwhelming
    imagery. The goal is to offer a safe, respectful, and empowering environment where art becomes a bridge
    to healing, connection, and personal growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for being here. Your presence supports the mission.
